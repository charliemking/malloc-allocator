# Custom Malloc Allocator

I implemented a custom memory allocator in C that mimics the behavior of `malloc` and `free`. It uses segregated free lists and slab allocation to manage memory across bins (8â€“64 bytes) with strict heap limits. This was one of my most technically challenging projects and helped me deeply understand systems programming and performance optimization.
